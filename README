The first few hits on google for 's3 delete older than' are "How do I do this?"
with no answers...

So, here's a script that will clean old s3 entries that match a pattern.

Requires boto.

  --regex=REGEX     Only consider keys matching this REGEX
  --bucket=BUCKET   Search for keys in a specific bucket
  --delete          Actually do a delete. If not specified, just list the keys
